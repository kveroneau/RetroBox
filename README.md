# RetroBox
An emulator management tool for 86Box

This program is not yet ready to be used, it is still under active and heavy development. I will
be committing each update to my Git repository as development proceeds so that people can see
how the program was built in a nice timeline if they so choose to see how it was made.

Currently, it has a basic preferences window to add categories and set a base path.  It cannot
currently launch any 86Boxes just yet, but that support should come very soon.

The main idea of the program, is to show a nice tree view with categories to make viewing and
managing your various Retro 86Boxes really easy.  I personally prefer seeing such things in a
tree, so it is much easier to sort and browse when needed.
